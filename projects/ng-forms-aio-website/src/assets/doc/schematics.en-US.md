Using a CLI helps initialize projects, generate template codes and reduce development time.
> The`NG-FORMS-AIO` scaffolding is essentially based on [schematics](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2).

## Initialize A Project

Initialize a project with `NG-FORMS-AIO`.

Run the command `ng add ng-forms-aio` under your project directory, and follow the options to configure settings including whether you want to import i18n files and stylesheets, and load initial modules.

In the meantime, you can choose an existing project template while creating your project, and then develop the project on the basis of it.

### Command

```bash
ng add ng-forms-aio [options]
```

## Component Generation

There are template source codes under every component API show case, you may obtain these codes by expanding `Show Code`.

### Command

```bash
ng g ng-forms-aio:[schematic] <name> [options]
```
